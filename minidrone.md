title: Mathworks Minidrone Competition
---

## Introduction
We are participating in [MathWorks Minidrone Competition at MATLAB EXPO 2019 UK](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student-competitions/minidrones/silver-circuit-2019.html). This student competition aims at designing a line follower algorithm for a minidrone using the latest features from Simulink.

## Implementation
Our algorithm submitted for the simulation round is capable of finishing different tracks. The shortlist for Round 2 will be released on 28 August 2019, stayed tuned for more information or [email me](mailto:Zhonghe.Jiang@outlook.com) if you are interested in doing similar project.
