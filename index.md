# Academic
I am a master student in Control Systems at Imperial College London. My master project is now carried out at [Robot Intelligence Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/) supervised by [Dr. Petar Kormushev](http://kormushev.com/). My research is focused on model predictive control for [SLIDER](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/robots/slider/), which is Imperial's first bipedal walking robot designed in our lab.

Before joining Imperial, I completed the "2+2" undergraduate program in Electrical and Electronic Engineering between Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) and City, University of London. The course has many extra modules in classical and modern control theory. I did my thesis project with [Dr. Stathis Milonidis](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/stathis-milonidis), where I designed the control algorithm for a rotary inverted pendulum.
